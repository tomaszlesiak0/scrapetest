Each unit is supplied ready to operate, once paired with another module a remote control system is created connections for power, antenna and input/output are the only connections required. Each module can be set to act as a transmitter or receiver. A remote telemetry system is achieved when two modules are paired together, as transmitter (ZuluTx) and receiver (ZuluRx). Each time an input changes on the ZuluTx, it will transmit the status of its inputs to the paired ZuluRx(s). which will set its outputs to follow the ZuluTx Inputs and reply back with an acknowledge signal.

Power is provided by a built-in electro-dynamic power generator. A common electro-dynamic energy transducer is actuated by a bow, which can be pushed from outside the module on the left or right by an appropriate pushbutton or switch rocker. When the energy bow is pushed down, electrical energy is created and a RF telegram is transmitted including a 32-bit module ID. Releasing the energy bow generates different telegram data, so every PTM telegram contains the information that the bow was pressed or released. In addition, the radio telegram transmits the operating status of 4 contact nipples when activating the bow. This enables the identification of up to 2 appropriate switch rockers or up to 4 single pushbuttons. Long or short pushbutton operation (the time between pushing and releasing the push button) can be easily detected by the receiver.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n          \r\n    Power generation by rocker operating electro-dynamic power generator\r\n          \r\n    Integrated PCB antenna\r\n          \r\n    902.875MHz Frequency band\r\n          \r\n    125kbps Data rate\r\n          \r\n    2 With 4 action states each (upper/lower pushbutton is pressed/released) channels\r\n          \r\n    1.8mm/typ. 8N Energy bow travel/operating force at room temperature\r\n          \r\n    -25 to +65°C Operating temperature\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n            Applications\r\n            \r\n            \r\n                        Communications & Networking, \r\n                    \r\n                        RF Communications","information":[{"name":"RF Modulation:","value":"-"},{"name":"Data Rate Max:","value":"125Kbps"},{"name":"Frequency:","value":"902.875MHz"},{"name":"Sensitivity dBm:","value":"-"},{"name":"Supply Voltage Min:","value":"-"},{"name":"Supply Voltage Max:","value":"-"},{"name":"Supply Current:","value":"-"},{"name":"RF Transmitter Applications:","value":"-"},{"name":"Product Range:","value":"-"}],"manufacturer":"ENOCEAN","manufacturer_part":"PTM 210U","origin_country":"Germany","files":["(EN)"],"file_urls":["http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1862648.pdf"],"image_urls":["http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/2382269-500.jpg","http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/2382269-501.jpg"],"trail":["Wireless Modules & Adaptors","RF Modules","RF Transmitters - Sub 2.4GHz ISM Band"],"primary_image_url":"http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/2382269-40.jpg","_type":"FarnellItem"},{"url":"http://uk.farnell.com/laird-technologies/prm241/rf-mod-txrx-900mhz-chip-ant-plug/dp/2067022","title":"PRM241 LAIRD TECHNOLOGIES, RF MOD, TXRX, 900MHZ, CHIP ANT, PLUG","overview":"PRM241 is a 915MHz RF Module high power pluggable with integrated antenna.

In addition, newer computers, especially laptop computers, do not necessarily have serial ports and a serial connection is limited by cable length (typically 10 m). Simply installing a Stellaris Serial-to-Ethernet Module into the legacy serial device provides many benefits including no major board redesign or software changes, easy sharing on a network other than

The MAX6369 is pin-selectable watchdog timer that supervises microprocessor (µP) activity and signal when a system is operating improperly. During normal operation, the microprocessor should repeatedly toggle the watchdog input (WDI) before the selected watchdog timeout period elapses to demonstrate that the system is processing code properly. If the µP does not provide a valid watchdog input transition before the timeout period expires, the supervisor asserts a watchdog (active-low WDO) output to signal that the system is not executing the desired instructions within the expected time frame. The watchdog output pulse can be used to reset the µP or interrupt the system to warn of processing errors.

The TX2 and RX2 modules will suit one to one and multi node wireless links in application.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n          \r\n    Miniature package\r\n          \r\n    Plug in compatible with FM-TX1 / RX1\r\n          \r\n    EMC conformant to ETS 300-683\r\n          \r\n    Type approved to ETS 300-220\r\n          \r\n    Data rates is 40kbit/s\r\n          \r\n    Usable range to 300 meters\r\n          \r\n    418 & 433.92MHz versions\r\n          \r\n    Single supply voltage 5v or 3v\r\n          \r\n    Fully screened\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n            Applications\r\n            \r\n            \r\n                        Security, \r\n                    \r\n                        Wireless, \r\n                    \r\n                        RF Communications, \r\n                    \r\n                        Industrial, \r\n                    \r\n                        Portable Devices, \r\n                    \r\n                        Power Management","information":[{"name":"RF Modulation:","value":"FM"},{"name":"Data Rate Max:","value":"-"},{"name":"Frequency:","value":"433MHz"},{"name":"Sensitivity dBm:","value":"-"},{"name":"Supply Voltage Min:","value":"-"},{"name":"Supply Voltage Max:","value":"-"},{"name":"Supply Current:","value":"10mA"},{"name":"RF Transmitter Applications:","value":"-"},{"name":"Product Range:","value":"-"}],"manufacturer":"RF SOLUTIONS","manufacturer_part":"FM-TX2-433","origin_country":"Great Britain","associated_parts":["FM-RTFQ2-433R","ANT-433MR","PU-M4-433"],"files":["(EN)"],"file_urls":["http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/11528.pdf"],"image_urls":["http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/1201011-500.jpg"],"trail":["Wireless Modules & Adaptors","RF Modules","RF Transmitters - Sub 2.4GHz ISM Band"],"primary_image_url":"http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/1201011A-40.jpg","_type":"FarnellItem"},{"url":"http://uk.farnell.com/rf-solutions/fm-rx1-433a/rf-module-receiver-fm-433mhz/dp/1201010","title":"FM-RX1-433A RF SOLUTIONS, RF MODULE, RECEIVER, FM, 433MHZ","overview":"FM-RX1-433A is a radio receiver module. This receiver module is a double conversion FM superhet with a data slicer driven by the AF output. Additionally, A fast acting carrier detect signal is a available to indicate to external circuits that a signal is present. This signal is extremely useful when implementing duty cycle power save circuits or to indicate to external logic that a signal is being received. It is internally derived from the degree of noise quieting due to the presence of a received carrier. The receiver is designed to work with the matching transmitter (FMTX). With the addition of simple antenna the pair may be used to transfer serial data up to 200meters. The range of the system depends upon several factors, principally the type of antenna employed and the operating environment.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n          \r\n    Selective double conversion superhet\r\n          \r\n    Low power\r\n          \r\n    Fast enable time\r\n          \r\n    wide supply voltage of 4.5 to 9 volts\r\n          \r\n    analogue & digital output\r\n          \r\n    High data rates (up to 5Kbps)\r\n          \r\n    Carrier detect output\r\n          \r\n    Available as either 418 or 433mhz\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n            Applications\r\n            \r\n            \r\n                        Security, \r\n                    \r\n                        Wireless, \r\n                    \r\n                        RF Communications, \r\n                    \r\n                        Industrial\r\n\r\n                        \r\n          \r\n    \r\n\r\nWarnings\r\nDo not adjust the trimmer.

The 725TRX telemetry system provides bi-directional, transceiver, remote switching. The module has two switch inputs and two relay changeover contact outputs. When two or more modules are paired together the relay outputs will follow the state changes of the other modules inputs. Additional input/output modules can be connected to provide extra inputs/outputs to a 725TRX. All signals are acknowledged and a watchdog feature means that when an input is activated, the status of its remote counterpart is assured. This is automatic, allowing the user to simply connect to the screw terminals and achieve a reliable telemetry link. Supply current is 50mA (quiescent), 101mA (all output relays operating), 25mA (watchdog relay operating), 95mA (when transmitting).

Each unit is supplied ready to operate, once paired with another module a remote control system is created. Connections for power, antenna and input/output are the only connections required. Each module can be set to act as a transmitter or receiver. A remote telemetry system is achieved when two modules are paired together, as transmitter (Zulu-2 Tx) and receiver (Zulu-2 Rx).

Flow code achieves this in two steps, firstly students drag and drop flowchart symbols onto the screen, fill in the dialog boxes when prompted. Then Flow code compiles the flow chart into code that is downloaded to a microcontroller which executes the program. This Flow code contains standard flow chart icons and electronic components that allow you to create a virtual electronic system on screen.

Each software module can be used together as an integrated electronics design environment. The easy PC For Windows is an advanced professional Schematic and PCB design system. Easy PC allows the user to draw the schematic and simulate it using the easy Spice A/D mixed mode simulator. The schematic editor enables easy modification of the components and values to check the performance of the circuit as required. Once the circuit is correct, within the same environment and using the same libraries, the schematic is translated to the PCB design editor and the printed circuit board is laid out. The easy router II auto router enables the conversion from the ratsnest into copper tracks. At all times the connectivity and design rules can be checked automatically to ensure that the PCB matches the schematic and that all the rules set have been obeyed.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n          \r\n    Fully integrated 32bit Windows program\r\n          \r\n    Schematic and PCB design editors included as standard\r\n          \r\n    Supplied with libraries and easy editing library manager\r\n          \r\n    A professional PCB design package capable of dense complex PCBs or simple single sided designs\r\n          \r\n    Link to optional integrated Spice based A/D mixed mode simulator\r\n          \r\n    Comprehensive design rules checking between schematic and PCB designs at all times\r\n          \r\n    True connective database, everything stays connected when moved or edited\r\n          \r\n    Unlimited layers (of any type)\r\n          \r\n    Accepts netlists from other systems such as OrCAD and EWB\r\n          \r\n    Pin limited variants available for 2000pins\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n            Applications\r\n            \r\n            \r\n                        Embedded Design & Development","information":[{"name":"Software Application:","value":"-"},{"name":"Software Edition:","value":"-"},{"name":"No. of User Licences:","value":"1"},{"name":"Supported Hosts:","value":"-"},{"name":"Features:","value":"Fully integrated 32bit Windows program, Schematic and PCB design, Supplied with libraries"},{"name":"Product Range:","value":"-"}],"manufacturer":"NUMBER ONE SYSTEMS","manufacturer_part":"EPCWIN-2000","origin_country":"Great Britain","files":["(EN)"],"file_urls":["http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1483548.pdf"],"image_urls":[],"trail":["Engineering Software","EDA, ECAD & MCAD Tools"],"primary_image_url":"http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/42270657.jpg","_type":"FarnellItem"},{"url":"http://uk.farnell.com/arm/em008/fixed-virtual-platform-aem-v8/dp/2460494","title":"EM008 ARM, Fixed Virtual Platform, ARM Cortex, Floating, Linux, Windows, 1 Licence","unit_price":51376,"stock_count":1,"information":[{"name":"Core Architecture:","value":"ARM"},{"name":"Supported Families:","value":"ARM8"},{"name":"Software Edition:","value":"-"},{"name":"Licence Type:","value":"Floating"},{"name":"No. of User Licences:","value":"1"},{"name":"Supported Hosts:","value":"Linux, Windows"},{"name":"Product Range:","value":"-"}],"manufacturer":"ARM","manufacturer_part":"EM008","origin_country":"Great Britain","associated_parts":["ULINKPRO","ULINKPRO D"],"files":["(EN)"],"file_urls":["http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1833303.pdf"],"image_urls":[],"trail":["Engineering Software","Compilers & IDEs","ARM Platform"],"primary_image_url":"http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/2460493-40.jpg","_type":"FarnellItem"},{"url":"http://uk.farnell.com/arm/em007/fixed-virtual-platform-aem-v8/dp/2460493","title":"EM007 ARM, Fixed Virtual Platform, ARM Cortex, Node Locked, Linux, Windows, 1 Licence","unit_price":34107,"stock_count":1,"information":[{"name":"Core Architecture:","value":"ARM"},{"name":"Supported Families:","value":"ARM8"},{"name":"Software Edition:","value":"-"},{"name":"Licence Type:","value":"Node Locked"},{"name":"No. of User Licences:","value":"1"},{"name":"Supported Hosts:","value":"Linux, Windows"},{"name":"Product Range:","value":"-"}],"manufacturer":"ARM","manufacturer_part":"EM007","origin_country":"Great Britain","associated_parts":["ULINKPRO","ULINKPRO D"],"files":["(EN)"],"file_urls":["http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1833303.pdf"],"image_urls":[],"trail":["Engineering Software","Compilers & IDEs","ARM Platform"],"primary_image_url":"http://uk.farnell.com/productimages/large/en_GB/2460493-40.jpg","_type":"FarnellItem"},{"url":"http://uk.farnell.com/xilinx/ef-vivado-system-fl/vivado-hl-design-suite-systemfl/dp/2780317","title":"EF-VIVADO-SYSTEM-FL XILINX, Vivado Design Suite: HL System Edition, Floating (Server) License","unit_price":335010,"stock_count":1,"overview":"The EF-VIVADO-SYSTEM-FL from Xilinx is Vivado® Design Suite with HL system edition and floating license.
