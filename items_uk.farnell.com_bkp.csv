The straps are designed to provide low impedance paths for EMG generated currents. Flexible and easy to fit they provide a low cost effective way of reducing EMC problems associated with conventional earth straps. At high frequencies the inductive resistance of round wire earth straps increases due to the 'skin effect'. This can be significantly reduced by using ZEMREX straps which present a large surface area. The straps are completely tinned to provide corrosion resistance and can be supplied with all round insulation as an option.

Rechargeable battery operation offers a convenient for Ex applications where a hand lamp is frequently required for long periods. It has both a Lloyds and an MCA type approval for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in marine applications. It offers the same extreme robustness and reliability for use in harsh environments found with hand lamp. The scratch and impact resistant lens is made from 6mm toughened glass. The body and lens ring is moulded in a highly resilient thermoplastic material able to withstand the drop and impact expected from heavy industrial use, even at sub-zero temperatures. Additionally the material is electrostatic non-hazardous, ensuring there is no risk of a dangerous build up of static charges. The lamp enclosure is preventing the ingress of dust and sealing against water in all conditions except submersion.

The MAX6369 is pin-selectable watchdog timer that supervises microprocessor (µP) activity and signal when a system is operating improperly. During normal operation, the microprocessor should repeatedly toggle the watchdog input (WDI) before the selected watchdog timeout period elapses to demonstrate that the system is processing code properly. If the µP does not provide a valid watchdog input transition before the timeout period expires, the supervisor asserts a watchdog (active-low WDO) output to signal that the system is not executing the desired instructions within the expected time frame. The watchdog output pulse can be used to reset the µP or interrupt the system to warn of processing errors. The MAX6369 is flexible watchdog timer supervisors that can increase system reliability through notification of code execution errors.

Each module can be set to act as a transmitter or receiver. A remote telemetry system is achieved when two modules are paired together, as transmitter (ZuluTx) and receiver (ZuluRx). Each time an input changes on the ZuluTx, it will transmit the status of its inputs to the paired ZuluRx(s). which will set its outputs to follow the ZuluTx Inputs and reply back with an acknowledge signal. Once completed the modules will then go into sleep mode.

For multiple radio systems a TXL2/RXL2 can be set to 1 of 8 unique addresses and having unique addresses, TXL2/RXL2 operated on one of 5 pre-set frequencies in the 433MHz band. These frequencies are non-overlapping and SIMultaneous operation of TXL2/RXL2 pairs in different channel.

Power is provided by a built-in electro-dynamic power generator. A common electro-dynamic energy transducer is actuated by a bow, which can be pushed from outside the module on the left or right by an appropriate pushbutton or switch rocker. When the energy bow is pushed down, electrical energy is created and a RF telegram is transmitted including a 32-bit module ID. Releasing the energy bow generates different telegram data, so every PTM telegram contains the information that the bow was pressed or released. In addition, the radio telegram transmits the operating status of 4 contact nipples when activating the bow. This enables the identification of up to 2 appropriate switch rockers or up to 4 single pushbuttons. Long or short pushbutton operation (the time between pushing and releasing the push button) can be easily detected by the receiver.

In addition, newer computers, especially laptop computers, do not necessarily have serial ports and a serial connection is limited by cable length (typically 10 m). Simply installing a Stellaris Serial-to-Ethernet Module into the legacy serial device provides many benefits including no major board redesign or software changes, easy sharing on a network other than Ethernet, tiny form-factor for unobtrusive implementation and 10-meter maximum cable length for serial connections is no longer a limitation.

The MAX6369 is pin-selectable watchdog timer that supervises microprocessor (µP) activity and signal when a system is operating improperly. During normal operation, the microprocessor should repeatedly toggle the watchdog input (WDI) before the selected watchdog timeout period elapses to demonstrate that the system is processing code properly. If the µP does not provide a valid watchdog input transition before the timeout period expires, the supervisor asserts a watchdog (active-low WDO) output to signal that the system is not executing the desired instructions within the expected time frame. The watchdog output pulse can be used to reset the µP or interrupt the system to warn of processing errors. The MAX6369 is flexible watchdog timer supervisors that can increase system reliability through notification of code execution errors.

The NTX2 transmitter and NRX2 receiver offer a low power, reliable data link in a Radiometrix SIL standard pin out and foot print. This makes the NTX2/NRX2 pair ideally suited to those low power applications where existing single frequency wideband UHF modules have insufficient range. NTX2 HP (25mW) variant can be used in applications where greater radiated power is desired. NTX2 & NRX2 modules combine effective screening with internal filtering to minimise spurious radiation and susceptibility thereby ensuring EMC compliance. They are particularly suitable for point to point and point to multipoint wireless links where longer ranges are required at low data rates.

This receiver module is a double conversion FM superhet with a data slicer driven by the AF output. Additionally, A fast acting carrier detect signal is a available to indicate to external circuits that a signal is present. This signal is extremely useful when implementing duty cycle power save circuits or to indicate to external logic that a signal is being received. It is internally derived from the degree of noise quieting due to the presence of a received carrier. The receiver is designed to work with the matching transmitter (FMTX). With the addition of simple antenna the pair may be used to transfer serial data up to 200meters. The range of the system depends upon several factors, principally the type of antenna employed and the operating environment.

Based on the market-leading Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR) BC04 chipset, the BT740-SC module provide exceptionally low power consumption with outstanding Class 1 range via 18 dBm of transmit power. A broad range of Bluetooth profiles such as Serial Port Profile (SPP) and other vital features make the modules superior to other Bluetooth modules. Another integration advantage is the inclusion of a complete Bluetooth protocol stack with support for multi-point connections and numerous Bluetooth profiles, including Serial Port Profile (SPP), Human Interface Device profile (HID), and Health Device Profile (HDP). An integrated AT command processor interfaces to the host system over a serial port using an extensive range of AT commands. The AT command set abstracts the Bluetooth protocol from the host application, saving many months of programming and integration time.

This miniature module enables two-way Bluetooth transmission over a range of 150m. It uses the 2.45GHz world frequency band. This module fully complies with the V2.0+EDR Bluetooth standard and data rate goes up to 3Mbps. Data exchange and set-up are only done through an UART data port under SPP profile which can be used in two modes ie command mode and transparent mode. A miniature antenna is integrated. The module converts data from a serial link into a Bluetooth radio frame to be sent to a similar piece of equipment. The operating parameters of the Bluetooth module (serial link, Bluetooth management) can be fully updated through AT commands via the serial link. The major advantage stems from the fact that this module is fully compatible with PDA's, laptops and Bluetooth GSMs.

Compatible with some of the most popular off-the-shelf data acquisition systems such as LabVIEW and DASYLab, xSenso is an ideal solution for remote monitoring and data logging of critical events in process control and automation applications. With its low port density, xSenso can be affordably installed in dispersed or remote locations. In applications where analog sensors and controllers are used, xSenso can be configured to send alarms via emails when the analog I/O readings are outside predefined ranges. These alarms allow control engineers to take immediate corrective action when certain thresholds are met.

This makes the NTX2/NRX2 pair ideally suited to those low power applications where existing single frequency wideband UHF modules have insufficient range. NTX2 HP (25mW) variant can be used in applications where greater radiated power is desired. NTX2 & NRX2 modules combine effective screening with internal filtering to minimise spurious radiation and susceptibility thereby ensuring EMC compliance. They are particularly suitable for point to point and point to multipoint wireless links where longer ranges are required at low data rates.

Each unit is supplied ready to operate, once paired with another module a remote control system is created. Connections for power, antenna and input/output are the only connections required. Each module can be set to act as a transmitter or receiver. A remote telemetry system is achieved when two modules are paired together, as transmitter (Zulu-2 Tx) and receiver (Zulu-2 Rx). Each time input changes on ZuLU-2 Tx, it will transmit status of its inputs to paired receiver. Which will set its outputs to follow the Zulu-2 Tx input reply back with an acknowledge signal. Once completed the module will then go to sleep mode. It is used in remote control, remote networking, remote switching and remote traffic lights.

Each module can be set to act as a transmitter or receiver. A remote telemetry system is achieved when two modules are paired together, as transmitter (ZuluTx) and receiver (ZuluRx). Each time an input changes on the ZuluTx, it will transmit the status of its inputs to the paired ZuluRx(s). which will set its outputs to follow the ZuluTx Inputs and reply back with an acknowledge signal. Once completed the modules will then go into sleep mode.

The module will handle raw data rates up to 64kb/s. The TX2H transmitter can be used with either RX2G or RX2A receivers. Instead of the SAW-based technology of the TX2, the TX2H uses a PLL circuit locked to a crystal for better frequency stability over a wider temperature range (-40C to +85C), at the expense of slightly slower power-up.

When two or more modules are paired together the relay outputs will follow the state changes of the other modules inputs. Additional input/output modules can be connected to provide extra inputs/outputs to a 725TRX. All signals are acknowledged and a watchdog feature means that when an input is activated, the status of its remote counterpart is assured. This is automatic, allowing the user to simply connect to the screw terminals and achieve a reliable telemetry link. Supply current is 50mA (quiescent), 101mA (all output relays operating), 25mA (watchdog relay operating), 95mA (when transmitting). Typical applications include industrial telemetry, remote monitoring and control, reliable remote switch.

The Antenna Tuning Indicator makes the resonance tuning of TI-RFid's Standard RFM (RI-RFM-104B) and the High Performance RFM (RI-RFM-007B) easy. LED's indicate in which direction the tuning core should be turned (RI-RFM-104B) or whether tuning capacitance need to be added or removed (RI-RFM-007B) to bring a connected antenna to resonance. As a second function, this tool helps to adjust the noise level threshold of a connected reader to best fit the actual environment of other interfering RF emitters. The Antenna Tuning Indicator also assists to optimise the wireless synchronisation of a S2000 system with multiple readers and so guarantees best possible reading performance. The ATI is connected directly to the RF Module via the ATI connector on the RF Module.

The surveillance camera market is steadily moving from analogue to digital. The reasons are clear, better imaging, intelligent image processing and the benefits of fully networked integrated solutions. Many digital camera support IP-based communication and are designed to connect to NVRs or video servers over Cat 5 or 6 Ethernet cables. But why waste perfectly functional 75R coaxial video cabling just to go digital. Microchip's Ethernet over coax media adapter allows 100Base-T standard-definition and high-definition megapixel IP cameras to use coax cabling to transmit IP-based communications to the NVR, servers or switches. Reusing the cable infrastructure also allows the analogue-to-digital transition to be done one camera at a time as needed. Microchip's Ethernet over coax adapters uniquely provide PoE bridging over the coax link to provide ample power (PoC) for remote devices.

These miniature RF modules provide a cost effective high performance FM radio data link at 433.92MHz and 868.35MHz. Manufactured using laser trimmed thick film ceramic hybrid, the modules exhibit extremely stable electronic characteristics over an industrial temperature range. Manufacture on a ceramic substrate provides a very reliable operation over a wide temperature range. This transmitter and receiver pair enables the simple implementation of a data link at up to 4.8Kbit/s at distances up to 75m indoors and 250m in open ground. Due to their small size and low power requirements, both modules are ideal for use in portable, battery-powered applications, such as hand-held terminals.

This RFM119W is a part of the HOPERF NextGenRF™ family which includes a complete line of transmitters, receivers and transceivers. It provides the simplest way to control the data transmission. The transmission is started when an effective level turnover is detected on the DATA pin. While the transmission action will stop after the DATA pin holding level low for a defined time window or after a two-wire interface (TWI) command is issued. The chip features can be configured in two different ways, setting the configuration registers through the TWI or programming the embedded RFPDK. It is used in remote fan controllers, infrared transmitter replacements, remote lighting control, remote keyless entry (RKE), wireless alarm and security systems.

This Flow code 3 is one of the World's most advanced graphical programming languages for microcontrollers. The great advantage of Flow code is that it allows those with little experience to create complex electronic systems in minutes. Flow code achieves this in two steps, firstly students drag and drop flowchart symbols onto the screen, fill in the dialog boxes when prompted. Then Flow code compiles the flow chart into code that is downloaded to a microcontroller which executes the program. This Flow code contains standard flow chart icons and electronic components that allow you to create a virtual electronic system on screen. The range of components is large and includes simple switches and LEDs, communication bus interfaces like I2C and SPI, and more advanced components such as Bluetooth and internet servers.

Easy PC allows the user to draw the schematic and simulate it using the easy Spice A/D mixed mode simulator. The schematic editor enables easy modification of the components and values to check the performance of the circuit as required. Once the circuit is correct, within the same environment and using the same libraries, the schematic is translated to the PCB design editor and the printed circuit board is laid out. The easy router II auto router enables the conversion from the ratsnest into copper tracks. At all times the connectivity and design rules can be checked automatically to ensure that the PCB matches the schematic and that all the rules set have been obeyed.
